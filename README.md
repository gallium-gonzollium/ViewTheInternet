<h1 align="center">ViewTheInternet v1.0</h1>

**ViewTheInternet** is a tool that maps the entire Internet's IPv4 space to a Hilbert curve, to demonstrate the concept of subnets, ownership, and special reserves.

It aims to build upon <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@tom7>SuckerPinch</a>'s version of <a href=https://sourceforge.net/p/tom7misc/svn/HEAD/tree/trunk/pingu/oping/>oping</a> featured <a href=http://tom7.org/harder/>here</a>, by making it memory-friendly, and augmenting the UI with many added features. Notably:

- Automatic Subnet Highlighting
- Automatic RDAP ("Whois") Lookup
- Context Menus

<h1 align="center">How to Set Up</h1>
